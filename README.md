-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Data is one of the basic elements in the development of artificial intelligence. With the continuous breakthrough of
large-scale pre-training model and related technology, it is becoming more and more important to use efficient data
processing tools to improve data quality in the corresponding research. So we launched FlagData, an easy-to-use and
easy-to-extend data processing toolkit. FlagData integrates several data processing tools and algorithms including data
acquisition, data preparation, data preprocessing and data analysis, which provides a strong data level support for
model training and deployment in natural language processing, computer vision and other fields.

FlagData supports the following features:

* Realize the high-quality content extraction of various original format data, and greatly reduce the processing cost.

* Provide the function of fine-tuning data perspective for large models.

* One-stop efficient distributed data processing function.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally install the `cleaner` module required in FlagData. You will only install the dependency packages for the
corresponding modules, which is suitable for users who only want to use the `cleaner` module and do not want to install
other module dependency packages.

```bash
pip install flagdata[cleaner]
```

**Install the latest version of the main branch**

The main branch is officially released by FlagData. If you want to install / update to the latest version of the main
branch, use the following command:

```

pip install .[all]
```

**Secondary development based on source code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagData.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Data acquisition phase

The LLM interface is utilized to construct a series of single rounds of SFT data for different abilities with three
different strategies. The strategies include:

+ ImitateGenerator: augment data using several case samples as templates. Supports simultaneous generation of data in
  multiple languages.
+ AbilityExtractionGenerator: using the LLM interface, generalize the abilities contained in several case samples.
  Generate new samples and answers based on this collection of capabilities.
+ AbilityDirectGenerator: Generate new samples directly related to a specified ability type or task type. For example,
  if you specify the ability as "Logical Reasoning", you can generate a series of logical reasoning questions and
  answers. In order to increase the diversity of generated samples, it is supported to exclude already generated
  samples.

See [ReadMe under data_gen Module](flagdata/data_gen/README.md) for an example.

### Data preparation phase

Under the all2txt module, the unstructured / semi-structured files such as pdf2txt and epub2txt can be converted into
txt, and it can well solve the problem of incoherent text content caused by single column, double column, and the order
of Chinese text interspersed with charts.

At the same time, the types of elements after parsing are "Table", "FigureCaption", "NarrativeText", "ListItem", "
Title [Chapter Title]", "Address [E-mail]","PageBreak", "Header [Header]", "Footer [Footer]", "
UncategorizedText [arxiv vertical number]", "
Image, Formula, etc. Tool scripts provide two forms: keeping full text and saving by category resolution.

See [ReadMe under all2txt Module](flagdata/all2txt/README.md) for an example.

### Data preprocessing phase

#### Language recognition

Under the language_identification module, the language classifier of fastText is used to classify. The language
classifier of fastText is based on Wikipedia, Tatoeba and SETimes.
The above training uses n-grams as a feature and uses a hierarchical softmax. Supports 176 language classifications, and
finally outputs a score of 0: 1.

+ Each CPU core can process a thousand documents per second.
+ Do a language classification for each web page and get the score of the classification.
+ For general cleaning rules, if it is greater than 0.5, it is classified as a specific language, otherwise it indicates
  that the page is not sure what language it is and discards the page.

See [ReadMe under language_identification Module](flagdata/language_identification/README.md) for an example.

#### Data cleaning

The cleaner module uses multi-process pool mp.Pool to process data in parallel in a multi-process manner. Use
SharedMemoryManager to create shareable data structures, and multiple processes share data in data processing.

Efficient data cleaning is achieved through multi-processes and shared memory:

Currently, the following cleaning rules are included:

+ Emoticons and meaningless characters (regular)
+ Clean and reprint copyright notice information (Zhihu, csdn, brief book, blog park)
+ Remove unreasonable consecutive punctuation marks, and newline characters are unified as\ n
+ Remove personal privacy, URL and extra spaces such as mobile phone number and ID number
+ Remove irrelevant content such as beginning and end, and remove text whose length is less than n (currently nasty 100)
+ Convert simplified Chinese to traditional Chinese (opencc Library)

It takes only two steps to use the data cleaning feature of FlagData:

1. Modify the data path and format in the YAML configuration file. We give detailed comments on each parameter in the
   configuration file template to explain its meaning. At the same time, you can refer
   to [Configuration](#Configuration) Chapter.

2. Specify the configuration file path in the following code and run it
   ```python
   from flagdata.cleaner.text_cleaner import DataCleaner
   if __name__ == "__main__": # Safe import of main module in multi-process
      cleaner = DataCleaner("config.yaml")
      cleaner.clean()
   ```

The cleaned file will be saved in the format `jsonl` to the path corresponding to the `output` parameter specified in
the configuration file.

See [Tutorial 1: Clean the original text obtained from the Internet](/flagdata/cleaner/tutorial_01_cleaner.md) for an
example.

#### Quality assessment

BERT and fasttext were selected as the evaluation model because they have the following advantages:

1. BERT model performs well in text classification and understanding tasks, has strong language comprehension and
   representation ability, and can effectively evaluate text quality.
2. FastText model has efficient training and reasoning speed, while maintaining the classification performance, which
   can significantly reduce the training and reasoning time.

This paper compares different text classification models, including logical regression, BERT and FastText, to evaluate
their performance. In the experiment, BERTEval and FastText models perform well in text classification tasks, and
FastText model performs best in terms of accuracy and recall rate. [experimental results are from ChineseWebText]

See [ReadMe under quality_assessment Module](flagdata/quality_assessment/README.md) for an example.

#### Data deduplication

deduplication Module provides the ability to deduplicate large amounts of text data, using MinHashLSH (Least Hash
Locally Sensitive Hash) by converting text into a series of hash values in order to compare similarities between texts.

We can control the parameter threshold, which represents the threshold of similarity, with values ranging from 0 to 1. A
setting of 1 means that there is an exact match and no text is filtered out. On the contrary, if a lower similarity
value is set, texts with slightly higher similarity will also be retained. We can set a higher threshold value as needed
to retain only those texts that are very similar, while discard those texts with slightly less similarity. The empirical
default value is 0.87. At the same time, we use the distributed computing power of Spark to deal with large-scale data,
the idea of MapReduce is used to remove duplicates, and tuned by spark to deal with large-scale text data sets
efficiently.
The following is the similar text iterated in the process of data deduplication, which has slight differences in line
wrapping and name editing, but the deduplication algorithm can identify two paragraphs of text that are highly similar.

```json lines
{
  "__id__": 3023656977259,
  "content": "\"2022海口三角梅花展\"已接待游客3万多名——\n三角梅富了边洋村\n一年四季,美丽的海南岛始终春意盎然、鲜花盛开,而作为海南省省花的三角梅就是其中最引人注目的鲜花品种之一,成为海南的一道亮丽风景线。\n\"可别小看这一盆盆普通的三角梅花,特别受游客喜爱。仅最近一个多月,我们就卖出了200多万元,盆栽三角梅销路火爆......吸引更多本地和外地游客来赏花、买花。(经济日报 记者 潘世鹏)\n(责任编辑:单晓冰)"

Integration of a single capability of spark:

Most of the time, we want to use the distributed data processing capability of spark. Here is a way to transform an
ordinary function into a spark udf function, and then use the spark capability.

But for functions that want to be transformed into spark tasks, you need to meet:

1. Data parallelism: the input data of a function can be divided into multiple parts and processed in parallel.
2. Serializable and immutable: Functions in Spark must be serializable in order to be transmitted across different
   nodes.
3. Does not depend on a specific compute node: the execution of the function does not depend on the computing resources
   or data storage location of a particular node so that it can be executed on any node in the cluster.
4. Stateless or shareable state: functions do not depend on external states or only on shareable states. This ensures
   that there are no conflicts or race conditions when executing functions in parallel on different compute nodes.

When using UDF, you should consider performance and optimization. Some functions may work well in a local Python
environment, but may not be efficient in a distributed Spark environment.
For complex logic or functions that require a lot of memory, further optimization and consideration may be required. UDF
is designed for simple logic and data processing, and for more complex calculations, you may need to use the
Spark's native operator for processing.

The deduplication module provides a common Python function (to determine whether it is a substring of other strings) to
use spark udf rewriting, which makes it easy to use spark distributed capabilities. For more information, please
see `stringMatching.py` and `stringMatching.py`.

If the user simply changes the python function to a spark task, it will not work without a spark cluster. Here a
detailed document of building a cluster is written in detail, which is convenient for novice users.

See [Spark cluster building](flagdata/deduplication/README.md) for an example.

### Data analysis phase

The analysis data analysis module provides the following functions:

+ the average turn analysis code of the text, and calculate the average number of rounds (take the newline character as
  an example)

+ the domain distribution of the text

+ the language distribution of the text

+ length analysis of the text.

See [ReadMe under analysis Module](flagdata/analysis/README.md) for an example.

## Configuration

For the `data cleansing` and `data quality assessment` modules,
We provide a profile
template:[cleaner_config.yaml](https://dorc.baai.ac.cn/resources/projects/FlagData/cleaner_config.yaml)， [bert_config.yaml](flagdata/quality_assessment/Bert/bert_config.yaml)。
The configuration file is readable [YAML](https://yaml.org) format , provides detailed comments. Please make sure that
the parameters have been modified in the configuration file before using these modules.

Here are some important parameters you need to pay attention to:

### Data cleaning

   ```yaml
   # Raw data to be cleaned
   input: ./demo/demo_input.jsonl
   # Save path of data after cleaning
   output: ./demo/output.jsonl
   ```

### Data Quality assessment

   ```yaml
   # Data evaluation models can be derived from[ChineseWebText download](https://github.com/CASIA-LM/ChineseWebText)
   pretrained_model_path: "models/bert-base-chinese"
   checkpoint: "models/pretrain/2023-08-16-21-36/model-epoch_19-step_2999.pt"
   # The text_key field is the field being evaluated
   text_key: "raw_content"
   ```

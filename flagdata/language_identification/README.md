LID stands for Language identification, which is a model for language identification.
It uses fastText's language classifier, which is trained on Wikipedia, Tatoeba, and SETimes, uses n-grams as features, and uses a hierarchical softmax. 176 languages are classified, and it outputs a score from 0 to 1.
Each CPU core can process one thousand documents per second.
For each web page, the language classification is done once, and the classification score is obtained. If it is greater than 0.5, then the page is classified as a specific language, otherwise, the page is not sure what language it is in and the page is discarded.

BERT and fasttext were chosen as evaluation models because they have the following advantages:

1. the BERT model performs well in text categorization and comprehension tasks, has strong language understanding and
   representation capabilities, and can effectively assess text quality.
2. FastText models have efficient training and inference speeds while maintaining classification performance, which can
   significantly reduce training and inference time.


   The article compares different text categorization models including logistic regression, BERT and FastText to
   evaluate their performance. In the experiments, the BERTEval and FastText models perform well in text categorization
   tasks, with the FastText model performing best in terms of precision and
   recall. [Experimental results from ChineseWebText].
